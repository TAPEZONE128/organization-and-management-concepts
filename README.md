## Non-Profit Organizations (NPO) 
- is a group organized for purposes other than generating profit. Unlike profit organizations, NPOs reinvest all income into the organization's mission or cause, without distributing any profits to members, directors, or officers.

### Key Characteristics
- Operate independently, sometimes with governmental funding but without direct government oversight.
- Legal responsibilities often include reporting on supervision, economic activities, accountability, auditing, and maintaining donor tax status.

### Common Goals and Activities
NPOs typically serve purposes in the areas of:
- **Religious** missions
- **Charitable** initiatives
- **Scientific** research
- **Public safety** efforts
- **Literary** and **educational** programs
- Promoting **amateur sports** (nationally or internationally)
- Preventing cruelty to **children or animals**

### Roles and Functions in Management
Management in NPOs includes the core functions of:
- **Planning**
- **Organizing**
- **Leading (Directing)**
- **Controlling**

## Management Roles
Henri Mintzberg, a renowned management theorist, defined ten managerial roles across three categories:

1. **Interpersonal Roles**
   - **Figurehead**: Symbolic leader for social/legal duties
   - **Leader**: Motivates and directs employees
   - **Liaison**: Builds external networks for information and partnerships

2. **Informational Roles**
   - **Monitor**: Collects organizational and environmental information
   - **Disseminator**: Shares information within the organization
   - **Spokesperson**: Represents the organization externally

3. **Decisional Roles**
   - **Entrepreneur**: Initiates projects for improvement
   - **Disturbance Handler**: Manages conflicts and crises
   - **Resource Allocator**: Directs resources to essential areas
   - **Negotiator**: Engages in significant negotiations
   
## NGO vs. NPO
- Both **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)** and **NPOs** aim to benefit the community, but NGOs generally operate on a larger, often global scale. NPOs usually work within local or national contexts.

### Scope and Scale
- **NGOs**: Operate on a **global scale**, addressing issues like climate change and human rights. They often engage in advocacy at international levels and work with governments and intergovernmental organizations. Examples include the **Red Cross** and **Amnesty International**.
- **NPOs**: Focus on **local or national contexts**, directly serving community needs such as education and health care. They engage in grassroots efforts and are typically community-oriented, addressing specific local issues.

### Focus and Mission
- **NGOs**: Have a broad mission that includes humanitarian aid and long-term development projects. Their focus can shift based on global trends and funding sources.
- **NPOs**: Tend to concentrate on specific local issues, often involving community members in decision-making. They prioritize programs that directly benefit their communities.

### Funding
- **NGOs**: Funded through international organizations, foreign governments, and large philanthropic foundations, enabling them to support large-scale projects.
- **NPOs**: Rely on local fundraising, individual donations, and government grants, which can limit their operational scale compared to NGOs.

> In essence, NGOs tackle global challenges while NPOs address local needs, making each vital in their respective roles in promoting public good. **Non-Profit Organizations** focus on advancing social, educational, and charitable causes without the intention of generating profit. They operate under strict legal and financial guidelines, with structured management aimed at achieving their community-centered goals effectively and responsibly.
